## Media
It can be kept in normal 10% DMEM, 5% CO2. However, it is better to kept them in low calcium condition where they are no longer able to differentiate to corneocyte so that the population is maintained and transfection is easier.

The table below gives you the idea that how much calcium in Media

| Name | Calcium concentration   |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| plain DMEM | ~ 1.9 mM          |
| FBS        | ~ 3 mM            |
| 10% DMEM   | ~ 2.2 mM          |
| low Calcium recipe  | 0.03 mM  |
| high Calcium recipe | 2.8 mM   |

The low calcium media recipe is below:

|    Item    |   concentration   |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Minimal DMEM (-calcium) |      |
| 3.0 mM CaCl2 in H2O     | 1:100|
| L-Glutamin              | 1:100|
| Sodium Pyruvate         | 1:100|
| Pen/Strep (antibiotic)  | 1:100|
| FBS (-calcium)          | 10%  |

### protocol to remove calcium in FBS:
for **50 ml** FBS, add **0.38g** chelex-100 rexin [Bio-Rad 142-2832](http://www.bio-rad.com/en-uk/product/chelex-100-resin)
rotate 1 hour @ 4 degree
filter before use (to remove chelex)

## Grow Monolayer
It is straightforward to grow monolayer. For my case, I want them to grow into monolayer after my 72 hour transfection. I seed 5000 cells in one well of 96 well-plate, transfecting them the next day. Then I will have good monolayer by the end of experiment.
